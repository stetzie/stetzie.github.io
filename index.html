        Are you ready for a new adventure? Rafting may be just the right ticket!
        We believe that there in nothing like a river trip for relaxing. That is
        why we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy of boating. Keeping your oars
        dry for us means taking time to look around and notice the beauty that
        surrounds the rivers we love.

      <h2 class="home-headline-2">Learn to whitewater raft.</h2>
      <p class="home-paragraph-2">
        You can do it. We can walk your through the whole experience. That
        doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after
        all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are looking down
        the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate the calm
        beautiful water that always follows even more.
